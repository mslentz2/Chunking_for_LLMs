Hobbits were a peaceful and clannish people who lived in the Shire. They had a love for good food and drink, and were skilled in the art of pipe-weed. Their history and legends only went back to their settlement in the Shire, but it was clear that they had once lived in the upper vales of Anduin. The Hobbits were divided into three breeds: Harfoots, Stoors, and Fallohides. They were known for their love of comfort and their ability to survive in tough conditions. They were also skilled in archery and had a deep connection with nature. As time passed, the Hobbits began to build above ground, but still maintained their love for their traditional homes in the ground. They were also known for their large families and intricate family trees. The Hobbits were also responsible for maintaining the borders of the Shire, known as the Bounders. However, strange occurrences and sightings at the borders hinted at a larger threat that few paid attention to.  

The Hobbits were given the land beyond the river and the Far Downs to dwell in by the King. They were only required to keep the Great Bridge in repair, speed the king's messengers, and acknowledge his lordship. This marked the beginning of the Shire-reckoning, with the year of the crossing of the Brandywine becoming Year One. The Hobbits fell in love with their new land and remained there, living peacefully and prospering for a thousand years. They were ruled by their own chieftains and did not meddle in the affairs of the outside world. The Shire was divided into four quarters and each had its own folklands. The Took family was pre-eminent and held the title of Thain, but their power was mostly nominal. The only real official in the Shire was the Mayor of Michel Delving, who was elected every seven years. The only Shire-services were the Messenger Service and the Watch, with the Messengers being the most numerous. The Shirriffs, or police, were more concerned with the strayings of beasts than people and there were only twelve of them in the entire Shire. 

Hobbits have a peculiar habit of smoking a herb called pipe-weed or leaf through pipes made of clay or wood. The origin of this custom is shrouded in mystery, but it is believed to have been invented by Hobbits themselves. The first known grower of pipe-weed was Tobold Hornblower of Longbottom, who learned about it during his visits to Bree. The Bree-hobbits claim to have been the first to smoke pipe-weed, and it is from there that the art of smoking spread to other races. However, it is believed that the plant itself originated from the lower Anduin and was brought over by the Men of Westernesse. It grows abundantly in Gondor and is larger and richer than in the North, where it is only found in warm, sheltered places.  

Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit from the Shire, returned from his adventure with a considerable amount of wealth. He kept the ring he found a secret, even from his favorite nephew Frodo. Bilbo's adventure began when the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves, including Thorin Oakenshield, came to his door seeking his help on a quest for treasure. They were successful in their quest, but it was an "accident" along the way that would change the course of history. Bilbo found a ring in the dark orc-mines, and it turned out to be the one ring that made its wearer invisible. He was then challenged to a riddle game by Gollum, a loathsome creature who lived in the mines. Bilbo won the game and escaped with the ring, but he kept the truth about how he obtained it a secret. Gandalf eventually learned the truth and was disturbed by Bilbo's dishonesty. Bilbo used the ring to help his friends on their journey, but he kept it a secret from everyone else. After his return, he never spoke of it again, except to Gandalf and Frodo. 

The text describes the history of the Hobbits and their interest in their own history, which was sparked by their involvement in the events that led to the inclusion of the Shire in the Reunited Kingdom. Many of their traditions and stories were collected and written down, and by the end of the Fourth Age, there were several libraries in the Shire containing historical books and records. The most important source for the history of the War of the Ring was the Red Book of Westmarch, which was originally Bilbo's private diary and was later filled with Frodo's account of the War. Copies of this book were made, including one that was written in Gondor and contained annotations and corrections. The text also mentions other historical works written by Hobbits, including Meriadoc's Herblore of the Shire and Reckoning of Years, and Peregrin's collection of manuscripts from Gondor. It is believed that Meriadoc obtained information from Rivendell, where Elrond's sons and some High-elven folk remained after his departure. The text ends by mentioning the departure of Celeborn, which marked the end of the last living memory of the Elder Days in Middle-earth.
